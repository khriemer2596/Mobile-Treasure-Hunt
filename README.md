<h1>Mobile Treasure Hunt</h1>

This is an Android mobile app that uses Location Services to send you on a treasure hunt
to a find 2 Chicago landmarks. This project is intended to showcase some of my skills using
Kotlin for mobile software development.

In this treasure hunt, your Android device will ask you to enable Location Services. Upon
doing so, you will be able to start the treasure hunt. The app will time you, so be quick!
You will be prompted with a clue and an optional hint for each landmark. When you think you
are at the landmark, press the Found It! button to see if you are correct. When you have
solved both clues, you will have successfully completed the treasure hunt, and you can
see your final time!

To run this app, simply clone this repository using Android Studio and run it.

Thanks for playing!
